# Junior Web Developer Test Project #

This is a mock-up of a portion of our Sale gateway.

**Requirements:**

* Create a mobile-first responsive grid of images. Specifically, on mobile-size screens, images should stack one image on top of another, on tablet-size screens stack 2 across, and the largest, desktop, images should be 3 across (see mockups for image placement).
* You must accomplish this task with some sort of grid framework. You can use any framework you'd like, including but not limited to Foundation, 960.gs, Skeleton, etc.
* Please commit the final project to your github account for us to review. It should include your .html file, .css file, and an image directory.

**Extra Credit:**

* Add a hover state to the images
* Use a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS
